      <h2>Accomodation</h2>
      <h3>Dry Creek Inn</h3>
      <p>This will be the main pick up and drop off point for getting shuttle buses to and from the wedding venue and is where we recommend guests stay. This is also where Sam will be staying the night before the big day. Whether you stay at the Dry Creek Inn or choose elsewhere in Healdsburg, please book early - Healdsburg is very popular in the summer months and tends to get more expensive the closer you get to the day. Dry Creek Inn is bookable now and should only require a deposit upfront.</p>

      <h2>How to Get to Healdsburg</h2>
      <p>Healdsburg is approximately 90 minutes drive from San Francisco. The easiest way to get to Healdsburg from San Francisco is to rent a car.</p>
      <p>Alternatively it is possible to get an Uber to and from Healdsburg - the cost would likely be around $125 each way and it may take a few tries to get a car that would take you that far but it is possible!</p>

      <h2>Trip Ideas</h2>
      <p>We know many of you will want to plan a larger holiday around the wedding so here are some ideas of other places you can visit while you're here:</p>
        <div class="trips">
          <h4>California road trip!</h4>
          <p>Hire a car for the week and drive the coast of California from San Francisco to LA. Stop on the way in Monterey bay, Big Sur, Carmel and Santa Barbara! </p>
          <h4>Party in Vegas!</h4>
          <p>Just a 1.5hr flight from San Francisco you can make the most of our summer with pool parties, shows, world class food and plenty of casinos!</p>
          <h4>Spend some time in Northern California.</h4>
          <p>There is so much to do from wine tasting in Napa Valley, hiking in Yosemite national park or paddle boarding on Lake Tahoe there is something for everyone just a car drive away.</p>
          <h4>For the Brits</h4>
          <p>Stop in New York, New Orleans, Cuba, Florida or a Caribbean island on the way back to break up the long haul flight.</p>
          <h4>For the Aussies</h4>
          <p>Swing by Mexico or Hawaii and top up your tan!</p>
        </div>
        <p> Let us know if you'd like any more specific recommendations for travel, hotels or things to do in any of those places!</p>
